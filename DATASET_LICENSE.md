# 📘 Dataset License and Usage Terms

## ©️ Copyrights

### 🧾 Apache License 2.0
The Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache 2.0) is a **permissive open-source license** developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Its main characteristics are:

- 🔓 **Free Use:** The software can be used for any purpose, including commercial applications.
- 🛠️ **Modification & Distribution:** Users may modify the code and redistribute original or modified versions.
- 🧑‍💻 **Attribution:** A copy of the license must be included and proper credit given to the original authors.
- 📄 **NOTICE File:** If the project includes a `NOTICE` file, it must be preserved during redistribution.
- 💡 **Patent Grant:** Contributors grant users a license to patents that would otherwise be infringed by their contributions.
- ⚖️ **Disclaimer:** The license provides the software “as is” without warranties or liability.

**Practical Implications:**
- 🧩 Permits integration into proprietary (closed-source) projects.
- 🔗 Allows combination with other open-source or commercial code.
- 🏷️ Enables redistribution under new branding.

**Restrictions:**
- 🚫 License and attribution notices cannot be removed.
- ❌ Modified versions cannot be misrepresented as the original work.
- ⚠️ Original authors cannot be held liable for issues.

### ⚖️ Fair Use

In addition to permissive open-source licenses such as Apache 2.0, the doctrine of **Fair Use** provides a legal framework that may justify the reuse of third-party datasets for research and educational purposes. Fair Use is codified under United States copyright law (17 U.S.C. §107) and is widely invoked in academic contexts, such as in our work. Its applicability is assessed through four key factors:

1. 🎯 **Purpose and character of use:** Non-commercial, educational, and research-driven usage is generally favored. Transformative use—where the dataset is repurposed for new scientific insights rather than replicating its original function—strengthens the case.  
2. 📚 **Nature of the copyrighted work:** Factual and scientific data are afforded less stringent protection compared to creative works, which supports their reuse in research.  
3. 📏 **Amount and substantiality:** Use of limited portions, or selective aspects of the dataset, weighs in favor of Fair Use. However, even large-scale use can be justified if it is essential for the research objective and transformative in nature.  
4. 💰 **Effect on the market:** If the research use does not undermine the commercial market or value of the original dataset, this criterion supports Fair Use.  

**Implications for research:**  
In practice, the reuse of existing datasets is often considered Fair Use when (i) the purpose is non-commercial and scholarly, (ii) the dataset is employed in a novel or transformative manner (e.g., re-annotating, constructing new benchmarks, or deriving insights not intended by the original authors), and (iii) proper attribution is provided.  

While Fair Use is context-dependent and not absolute, adherence to these principles allows researchers to **legally and ethically justify** their use of external datasets in the advancement of science.

## ⚠️ Usage Considerations

This dataset is intended **solely for research and educational purposes**, and users are expected to exercise appropriate caution in its use and interpretation. As this is a medical dataset, it may inherently contain **human and/or machine annotation errors**, as well as potential biases or inconsistencies that are beyond our current understanding or control.

While we have made every effort to ensure ethical data collection, careful annotation, and responsible release, we acknowledge that **no dataset can be guaranteed to be entirely free of error or unintended harm**. Our team holds a deep respect for ethical principles and believes strongly in the notion of **karma and responsibility**—we have done our utmost to act in good faith throughout the creation and curation of this dataset.

Users are therefore **strictly advised** to:
- 🧪 Pilot test any models, analyses, or clinical applications derived from this dataset before applying them to real-world or human-related scenarios.
- 🚷 Avoid direct clinical use or decision-making based solely on this dataset without rigorous validation and oversight from qualified professionals.
- ⚠️ Acknowledge potential limitations in any derivative work or publication.

By using this dataset, users accept that the authors and contributors **cannot be held responsible for any consequences** arising from misuse, misinterpretation, or overreliance on the data. Ethical stewardship and cautious application remain the user's responsibility.
